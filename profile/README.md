# Welcome to the BeamMP GitHub Organisation 👋

## Introduction

BeamMP is a small group of developers that have come together to add Multiplayer to BeamNG.drive.
The project consists of several key parts, The Mod which enables all functionality with the game. The Launcher which enables the network communications, mod download and launching of the game. The Server which provides the central hub for all players to communicate through.
These 3 key parts are backed up by our Docs which is also accessible by everyone so that anyone can help correct, improve or add to it to help the community further!

The project has been broken down into some key repositories:
- Lua mod which can be found here: https://github.com/beammp/beammp

- Server which can be found here: https://github.com/beammp/beammp-server
